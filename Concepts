##Code Design
Main class - launches window, initializes components.
Window - contains menu, control panel, sandbox.  Handles user interaction
Sandbox
Controls - static set of values defining behavior of <entity>s

Location - x/y coordinates (in terms of sandbox)
<Entity>Locations - table of x/y coordinates
Tied into controls upon creation
CheckForProximity(location) // returns list of locations within distance specified by controls

<entity> - Thread based, no outside manipulation other than commands (move here, form line)
Public
Constructor - no-args / with location, color, orientation, ties to controls fields
Move (location)
FormShape(shapeEnum)
Kill()
Private
Run(not private) 	// only called upon creation, while(true){do stuff, sleep}
CheckNeighbors()	// checks for nearby <entity>s
Advance()		// moves speed distance per tick
UpdateLocation()	// Alerts table of new location




Once a formation is reached (within margin of error) lock in neighbors.  Keep their relative position constant.  Allowing formation to move.

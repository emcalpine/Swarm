# Swarm
Multi-threaded swarm simulation as a proof-of-concept of highly-scalable, self-directing entities.

Implementation to be done in Java, due to my knowledge of threads.  Entities will do all calculations internally, with the exception of collision detection.  That will be handled by the environment.
